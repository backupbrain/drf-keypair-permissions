# Crypto Keypair Authorization for Django Rest Framework
This Django module was created to give "Cavage" HTTP Signatures capabilities to the Django Rest Framework.

This enables HTTP authorization based on public key/private key encryption as an alternative to session cookies or API tokens.

In your Django code, it looks like this:
```python
from keypair_permissions.permissions import HasHttpCryptoAuthorization

class EchoServerApiView(GenericApiView):
    permission_classes = [HasHttpCryptoAuthorization]
    def get(self, request):
        return Response(request.body)

```

Doing so will require an `Authorization` HTTP header that looks like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 POST /foo
Authorization: Signature algorithm="hs2019",keyId="keyname",signature="MEUCIGGB0P3P/iZCzCbX1fj1Q6AbYPJr9dEBYcsuiLoS3q6uAiEAkEjvmWfuN1UDPmYCkBywnI/MwisCuNEmlAxPB3ZBVgc="
... other headers ...
```

This authorization header is created by signing Request headers with a private key on the client. The server then verifies the Request was sent by a known client by verifying the signature using the client's public key.

Additionally, a `Digest` header can be added to ensure the Request body was transported in tact:

```
Digest: SHA512=WZDPaVn/7XgHaAy8pmojAkGWoRx2UFChF41A2svX+TaPm+AbwAgBWnrIiYllu7BNNyealdVLvRwEmTHWXvJwew==
```

Each public key can be associated with a Django User, so the User can be accessed from the View:

```python
class EchoServerApiView(GenericApiView):
    permission_classes = [HasHttpCryptoAuthorization]
    def get(self, request):
        user = request.public_key.user
        return Response(request.body)
```

## Quickstart

Install:

```
$ pip install drf-keypair-permissions
```

Add `keypair_permissions` to your `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`:

`settings.py`:
```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
	...
	'keypair_permissions',
]
```

Migrate the database

```
$ ./manage.py makemigrations
$ ./manage.py migrate
```

Include to your project

`views.py`:
```python
from keypair_permissions.permissions import HasHttpCryptoAuthorization
```

Set the `permission_classes` of API views to include `HasHttpCryptoAuthorization`:

```python
class EchoServerApiView(GenericApiView):
    permission_classes = [HasHttpCryptoAuthorization]
    def get(self, request):
        return Response(request.body)
```

Or use across your entire API by setting `REST_FRAMEWORK['DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES']`:

```python
REST_FRAMEWORK = {
    'DEFAULT_PERMISSION_CLASSES': [
        'keypair_permissions.permissions.HasHttpCryptoAuthorization',
    ]
}
```
